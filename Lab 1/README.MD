# Lab 1: Github Portfolios and User Story Mapping

## Assignment Requirements: 
- Grocery Delivery App:

Using StoriesOnBoard, create a new, private, solo board which represents the User Story Map for an application for getting groceries delivered. Focus primarily on the user side of the application, e.g. less on the drivers or administrators. Perform User Story Mapping to develop a map which captures the most necessary user stories for this application. In accomplishing this, you should have:

At least three epics in the backbone
At least six steps in the walking skeleton
At least 18 total tasks
All tasks need to have a name, status and time estimate, but the estimates need not be realistic
At least 3 detailed tasks
Edit the details for at least three tasks and try out at least three different features available in markdown features
At least 2 releases, including some unscheduled tasks
At least 1 extra feature not discussed in lab, such as additional card colors, annotations or personas
A readme.txt file which explains the following:
Your general thought process for developing your user story map
At least three decisions you made when creating the stories in map
Why you made those decision
How the results of those decision are captured in the user story map
What is the extra feature that you tried?
Please note that the map does not need to exhaustively capture every feature of the application.

Running Assignment - Development Portfolio

Start a new (private for now) GitHub Repo which will be your portfolio for the course
Upon completing assignments, take screenshots and push them to the repo
You will add to this repo all semester!
For this lab, you only need to have a readme.md uploaded, which contains markdown code that explains the purpose of the repoistory.

## Overview:

- My general thought process for developing my story map was broken down into three main topics: Ordering, Account, and Payment. I made it into this order because that's typically the order process the user takes when trying to purchase something from a website. Under those three main topics, I drafted some points that I would want to implement for it. One of the decisions I made was the ordering process for the application. It follows a linear pathway that starts off from finding the products to examining it, and then eventually adding it to cart. I made it that way because I based it off the same process from the company Amazon, and because I also found it quite simple and easy to navigate. Another decision I made was starting off with the user creating an account with their preferred email rather than with Facebook or Gmail was because I thought to myself that not everyone has an account with those. And so, I made it so that users can sign up using their preferred email so all emails from different companies can be used. Lastly, for one of the unscheduled cards, I added a card that allows users to enter multiple addresses. I made this because one, users may not always be at their homes and need said things delivered to another location, and another reason could be for purchasing things for others. An extra feature that I tried was changing the colours for the unscheduled cards!
