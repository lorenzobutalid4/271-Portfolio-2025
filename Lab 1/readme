Lab 1

My general thought process for developing my story map was broken down into three main topics: Ordering, Account, and Payment. I made it into this order because that's typically the order process the user takes when trying to purchase something from a website. Under those three main topics, I drafted some points that I would want to implement for it. One of the decisions I made was the ordering process for the application. It follows a linear pathway that starts off from finding the products to examining it, and then eventually adding it to cart. I made it that way because I based it off the same process from the company Amazon, and because I also found it quite simple and easy to navigate. Another decision I made was starting off with the user creating an account with their preferred email rather than with Facebook or Gmail was because I thought to myself that not everyone has an account with those. And so, I made it so that users can sign up using their preferred email so all emails from different companies can be used. Lastly, for one of the unscheduled cards, I added a card that allows users to enter multiple addresses. I made this because one, users may not always be at their homes and need said things delivered to another location, and another reason could be for purchasing things for others. An extra feature that I tried was changing the colours for the unscheduled cards!
