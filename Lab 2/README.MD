# Lab 2: Asset Inventories and Site-Maps

## Assignment Requirements:

- Competitor Analysis and Content Audit

For this assignment, you are to find a SMALL (I can’t stress this enough!) website, in the range of 3 to 5 pages. Assume you have been tasked to redesign this website - but you must first analyze the existing content.

You are to create a sitemap and an asset inventory for this site as it currently exists.

Be sure to click around. Look for pages which are not listed in the main navigation. When hunting for assets, don’t forget things like icons, text and images. If you see a carousel as a hero banner, list out the images.

You may, but do not need to, find the actual filename for an image, but could instead choose something appropriate. It is strongly recommended to name your files in the Linux standard format, as linux is the standard for servers on the web:
lowercase
separate words with dashes
brief but descriptive names
eg. coffee-with-cream.png
These analysis methods are more suited to static websites. If you find dynamic content, like forums, blog posts or galleries, these do not need to be exhaustively documented in the asset inventory, instead, simply document all of the content for one entry, eg. one blog post, one forum post, etc., and include a database asset.

Include a text file which includes the name of the site which you are documenting

Good types of websites to analyze: Personal CVs / portfolio pages, small organization pages, single product websites

*** Look through a website first to get a rough idea of the amount of work before committing to document it - I’m not trying to take up too much of your time with this assignment, just give you some practice using the techniques and tools discussed.


## Tools used:

- Figma
