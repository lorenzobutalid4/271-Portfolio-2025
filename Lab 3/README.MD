# Lab 3: High-Fi Wireframes with Figma

## Assignment Requirements: 

- Head to the website Dribbble, which is a website where designers showcase their UI work. Find a UI design you like which includes at least 10 unique components. I am using the term component to be a complete visual element, e.g. an image, a button, an icon, etc. For example, I would count 16 component in the following design:


- Your assignment is to attempt to recreate this design in Figma.

Rules:

If elements are clearly just images, you may screen-capture them, or find a similar image on the internet. Max 3 elements can be just pictures. If your design has more pictures, that’s fine, but you’ll need at 7 least seven more component.
If an element is not an image, and is just geometry, you must attempt to make it. (Rounded rectangles, clipped chunks, etc.)
Repeated elements only count as one module, even if there are minor variations, e.g. different photos or different text do not count as different components
Component may be nested
Do not choose a project that is too ambitious!
You may choose a mobile or desktop design.
You can do just one or two pages of a multi-page design as long as it has at least 10 components.
Please cite the designer of your website or app, especially if you plan to use this on a portfolio afterwards (give credit where credit is due!).
