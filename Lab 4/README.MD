# Lab 4: Hi-Fi Prototypes with Figma

## Assignment Requirements: 

- Your project for this lab is to create a virtual tour, a prototype of a simple webpage which simulates touring a real-world (or fictional) location such as a national park, a tourist destination, or a science-fiction or fantasy world from a book, media or game. You virtual tour should include:

A home page
Some type of menu (properly connected so that every page is accessible)
Three landmark pages, which showcases a specific feature of your locale, with a page for each
Each landmark should have a name, a set of images and text description
The images should be stored in some type of interactive image container
You can use ones from the pre-lab, or create your own
Use a different type of interaction for each page
At least one of the three must include a Smart Animate of a transform, such as size
Leave a note in the figma file to explicitly show where you are using the Smart Animate
Please include some images from the landmarks. You can find many images on the web in the creative commons, but for education purposes, it is okay to included copyrighted images as this project as it is for educational / non-commercial purposes. Just be aware of the implications if you intend to use this in your portfolio.

As we are now at the half way point of the lab, do not forget about your running assignment of maintaining a github portfolio! This would be a good time to ensure everything is up to date, well organized, and easy to navigate. Think about users browsing your page as a portfolio, are they likely to download and open up “.fig” files, or would they rather see screen capture images presented in easily to see markdown files?
